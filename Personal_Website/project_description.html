      “We are not alone” is a project consisting of a three-dimensional networked space where one can spawn a unique artefact that can stand for them and reflect their presence in that space. The project is an exploration of how human beings have a desire to be amidst others. Not only humans tend to want to be seen and felt by others, they are capable of feeling a presence without it needing a body. Divine beings, spirits, personified objects and extraterrestrial beings are examples of such body-less presences. Such feelings may arise in a digital space as well. How does one know that one is perceiving and is perceived by another being when they are just looking at a screen? Often, such as on social media platforms, a presence is felt because it is tied to a real-life identify (a real name, a face, etc). However, this project allows users to detach themselves from their identity and present themselves in an alternate manner, i.e. as an abstract 3D model in a shape of a blob or wave pattern. The user will be able to navigate the digital space and explore the models created by other people. The 3D model was meant to evolve from interacting with other models or spending time in the space.  Its shape and colors were meant to change. Users might choose whom they want to interact with and whom they want to evolve towards. They might agglomerate into groups or wish to remain alone. The way that the users behave in that world was meant to change what the world looks like.

      A few elements have currently been completed for the project. The way the 3D artefact is generated has been determined. It will look like an agglomeration of precious stones and metals embedded in a rock. This symbolizes the preciousness and uniqueness of the artefact and the user that created it. Additionally, formation of such rocks is a natural phenomenon and is a closer representation of the organic being that is the user. The formation will be symmetrical, as to reinforce the feeling that it is alive, since most living things are symmetrical too. The artefact could be composed of translucent gems and reflective metals. Such interactions with light provide a greater sense of realism and sense of three-dimensional space, allowing the user to feel more embodied in it. Currently the formations are generated quasi-randomly. However, some parameters can be modified by the user, such as the reflectivity of the metal parts, the color of the gems and the scale of different components. Eventually, I would like to make the formation of rocks entirely customizable. Formation of the different components would be less random but more kaleidoscopic: a simple 3D model serves as a base which is sequentially mirrored in three dimensions to create a more complex model.  The user might have the ability to shift the base model’s position, which will completely change the appearance of the final model. Customization becomes important since it allows the user to be more attached to their creation. It gives them agency over the creation of a new, alternative identity that does not rely on their real one. Since the user will spend time creating it and hopefully might create something they are satisfied with, their presence will be more imbued into their artefact. Additionally, this might give the user a greater interest in exploring what others have created since they might have spent time on it too. When a user releases their creation into the networked space, it is a way for them to leave their mark on it, signal that they have been there and that their mark is recognizable because it is unique to them. Users will have the opportunity to place their gem into this world and allow others to find it. The user might be notified whenever their gem has been found by others. This type of interaction might allow the user to get a better grasp of the fact that they are in a communal space, surrounded by individual and distinct presences. An idea to create a visual mark of an interaction between to users is to spawn a point light at the position where two users have interacted. Eventually, I would hope for that digital world to be full of gems and lights, which would visually translate the richness that a networked space can take.

      Another completed element is the creation of the terrain. Currently, the terrain looks cartoon-like and low-poly. It is colored with blues for water, greens for grass, brown for mud and grey for rocks. However, it does not create a good background for the user’s artefact because of its lack of realism. Additionally, since the artefact reflects and refracts light, it becomes colored with the background environment which makes it look less appealing. It might be preferable for the terrain to be less saturated, perhaps pulling more towards the whites, greys or beiges as to create a better contrast with the formations of gems, rocks, and metals. Since the artefact will stand out more from such an environment, users might find other users’ avatars more easily. The terrain will eventually have a higher polygon count as to look more realistic. There is a possibility to make the geography of the digital space translate to the one of the Earth. Users will spawn in a place that is related to their geographical location. The different weather from around the world can dictate how sections of the virtual world will look like. This might make the world fell more alive, less static, and might make the users more interested in exploring it.

      The last section of the project that needs to be developed is the movement of the user through the space. There is a possibility to use the traditional W/A/S/D controls. However, it might more interesting for the users to “fly” over the space using their mouse to guide the direction in which they will be going in. This way, users may be able to fly high above the terrain, look down a perceive the world from above, just like in Google Earth. Such a view will give users a better understanding of the space, a different perspective of it and a better grasp that they are amidst multiple presences. A collision detection between the users and the terrain should be instituted so that the users don’t fall into the ground.

      Users that have tested the prototype provided positive feedback. One of the questions asked to them was whether they would be interested in spending some time creating the formation of gems or if that formation should be generated randomly. Users preferred to be given the opportunity to customise what their artefact would look like. Some have said that the concept of gems and reflective metals is aesthetically pleasing and positively portrays that a person’s presence in this networked space was considered as something unique and special. Users were also asked if they would be interested to explore the world and most have answered positively. They have insisted that there should be a way to interact with the other users, apart from just viewing their creation. One person suggested that users should be able to click on others when they have found them, and they should be notified when someone clicked on them too.  Testers were asked if they felt as if they participated in something communal, something bigger than themselves. Some have answered positively, adding that the world seemed like a hide-and-seek game.

      The data that will need to be saved from each user is numerous. First, the 3D model data should be saved. This considers the color of the gems, reflectivity of the metals and the position of the different vertices of the model. Furthermore, the position of the user in the 3D space needs to be saved as well. The date/time and position where a user has been interacted with by others should be saved.  Such data should be possible to access by every other user. Additionally, weather data should be extracted a few times per day. This data will then transform the appearance of every section of the world. As such every user needs access to the world’s state at their specific position.
